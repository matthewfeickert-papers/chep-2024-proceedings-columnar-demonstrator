\section{Preliminary Performance Tests and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

During the ongoing refactor added preliminary integrated benchmark to measure time spent in tool per event (not I/O) and compare to xAOD model.
While direct comparison not possible, tests are as close as possible.
Only involves \texttt{C++} CP tool code (no Python involved).
Uses same version of CP tool.
xAOD includes event store access (per-event overhead, paid per-batch in columnar).
Show substantial speedups for migrated tools: columnar is 2-4x faster than xAOD interface (EDM access dependent).
Time for I/O and connecting columns not included in the performance comparisons (not optimized in the tests, so removed from benchmark).
