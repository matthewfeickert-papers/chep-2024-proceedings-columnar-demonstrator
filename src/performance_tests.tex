\section{Preliminary Performance Tests}\label{sec:performance}

During the ongoing refactor for the \texttt{v2} prototype, preliminary integrated benchmarks have been created to measure the time spent in each tool (excluding I/O) in comparison with the xAOD model.
While direct one-to-one comparisons are not possible given the inherent differences in data access\footnote{Columnar implementations access the EDM once per event batch, while the xAOD interface accesses the EDM for each event.}, the tests have been designed to be as close as possible.
The benchmarks compare the same version of each CP tool, only use the \texttt{C++} code (no Python is involved so as to isolate the \texttt{C++} performance), and the time for the xAOD model includes the event store access overhead (which is per-event for the xAOD model and per-batch for the columnar model).
The time for I/O and connecting columns is also not included in the performance comparisons, as this has not been optimized in the current tests and will not provide useful information, and so is excluded from the benchmark.
The benchmarks show substantial speedups for the migrated tools with the columnar implementations ranging from being \emph{2-4x faster} than the xAOD interface.
The specific reasons for the speedups are currently being investigated fully, but preliminary checks show a relation with EDM access.
