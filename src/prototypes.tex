\section{Prototypes}\label{sec:prototypes}

As a first (\texttt{v1}) prototype of this capability, external zero-copy \texttt{nanobind} Python bindings to a columnar implementation of the ATLAS Egamma CP tool were created to compute on-the-fly systematics for $m_{ee}$.
Uproot was used to load PHYSLITE ATLAS simulation into Awkward arrays, and event selections were applied with Coffea.
The standalone Pythonic interface to the Egamma tool, \texttt{atlascp.EgammaTools}, was initialized and then systematics were computed on-the-fly while being scaled out with \texttt{dask-awkward}~\cite{dask_awkward_2024} on the University of Chciago ATLAS Analysis Facility.
The results are plotted in~\Cref{fig:Zee_mc_systematics}.
This \texttt{v1} prototype established foundations of what was possible with new tooling and that Pythonic interfaces to CP tools could be written without large amounts of work or deep knowledge of underlying CP tool design.
This was promising, but additional work was needed to achieve necessary performance required for use.
Though as there was no ``zero action'' option --- some amount of research was required to determine the viability of the proposed design --- this prototype was valuable.

Following this work, a \texttt{v2} ``Columnar Athena'' prototype~\cite{columnar_athena} has been started to expand the scope of the work.
This moves the development of the columnar CP tools and interfaces from standalone examples into the ATLAS Athena framework~\cite{ATLAS_Athena} and migrates the ATLAS CP tools to a columnar backend with breaking the existing workflows using the EDM models.
It additionally adds infrastructure support for development of columnar analysis tools by adding \texttt{nanobind} to the ATLAS Externals tooling distributed as part of the ATLAS Athena Analysis Releases.
While currently under active development, the \texttt{v2} prototype will allow for full scale integration and performance tests of the columnar CP tools and interfaces.
